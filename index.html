			<p>	Welcome to my blog! I am Frederic from India. I am using this blog to save my thoughts.

This is my Personal Blog. Here you can find infos about the important Projects I have done so far, mostly in the field of Robotics and Embedded Systems.

I am currently doing my Masters in Embedded Systems at the University of Freiburg, Germany.

I also work as a Research Assistant in Smart Wearable Devices.

My full CV can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1M7j-ZJdtFAemn8P0hSipeaJlgSE4UcrezVkQWHl1KtE/pub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><font color="orange">here</a></font>.

Happy Blogging!
